  - Handshake initiates but fails with cipher decrypt error
  - Root cause: Possible I/O buffer lifecycle or tls.zig library issue
  - **Workaround**: Use reverse proxy (nginx/HAProxy) for production TLS

### High Priority
- [ ] Need to verify thread safety of all shared resources
- [x] ~~Authentication accepts any credentials (development mode)~~ (Fixed: now uses database with Argon2id)
- [ ] Rate limiter cleanup not scheduled

### Medium Priority
- [x] ~~No connection timeout enforcement yet~~ (Fixed in 0.2.0)
- [x] ~~No maximum recipients per message limit~~ (Fixed in 0.1.0)
- [ ] No DATA command timeout (partial - general timeout implemented)
- [ ] HTTPS webhooks not supported (HTTP only)

## Research Needed 🔬

- [ ] Best practices for email server security
- [ ] Modern SMTP server architectures
- [ ] Email deliverability optimization
